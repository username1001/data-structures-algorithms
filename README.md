# Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript

Following the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-JavaScript-approaches/dp/1449364934">Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript</a>. This repository will host notes from the book.

**Note:** I've changed the code to use ES6 syntax rather than ES5, as per the book. Also, I'm not going through the entire book. I started chapters 1 and 2, but I've got a solid understanding of the material, so I glimpsed them without taking much notes.
